- ran the rename python script to rename all V1 joints to atlas

Drake required a few manual changes:
- copied the result from above
- changed .stl to .wrl
- made dummy wrl files
- removed all of the transmission components as drake did not parse them
- added collision groups on the r_foot and l_foot to match atlas
- TODO: place these points on the heels of the robot
