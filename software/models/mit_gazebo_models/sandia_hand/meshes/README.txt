Had to manually edit wrl files after meshlab generation.
TODO: write a script to do this.

1) remove meshlab generated comment after "#VRML V2.0 utf8" and replace it with "DEF <insert meshname>"
 
#VRML V2.0 utf8  
<< # Generated by VCGLIB, (C)Copyright 1999-2001 VCG, IEI-CNR
>> DEF <insert meshname>
