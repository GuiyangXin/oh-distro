Notes:
These set of urdf files are only for the viewer and drake.
There is no point having a manifest.xml in this folder which is only necessary if you want gazebo to be able to find these files. 

The urdf's in this folder as used to spawn a collection of robotic hands in drake and the viewer for interactive grasp synthesis. The drake specific urdfs are in the drake_urdfs folder.
