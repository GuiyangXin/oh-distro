Maintainers:  Sisir K and Maurice F
Summary:     Communicates to gazebo/robot API to get joint angles and then 
publishes them on MEAS_JOINT_ANGLES lcm channel.

Description:

1) meas_joint_angles_publisher:
This process communicates to gazebo/robot API to get joint angles and then 
publishes them on MEAS_JOINT_ANGLES lcm channel. The publisher requires access to

lcm channel, waits until it receives the urdf string and then unsubcribes from this
channel.

For an example usage, try the following commands in a set of terminals in the specified order:
Term1: ./meas_joint_angles_listener
Term2: ./meas_joint_angles_publisher
Term3: ./broadcast_robot_model atlas_robot.urdf (requires the robot_model_publisher pod)
