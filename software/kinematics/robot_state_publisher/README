Name:         robot_state_publisher
Maintainers:  Sisir K and Maurice F
Summary:      Provides i) a ROS style tf publisher ii) a library for performing full forward kinematics using the KDL library. This gene
Description:
  FILL-ME-IN

Requirements: 
 urdf orocos-kdl kdl-parser 

License:      FILL-ME-IN

Description:
This pod provides three processes and one library. 

1) robot_state_publisher:
Subscribes to JOINT_STATES lcm channel to get joint angles and then 
publishes them as ROS style tf_t messages on JOINT_TRANSFORMS lcm channel.
The publisher requires access to the urdf robot model. 
At startup, the process creates a subcription to ROBOT_MODEL lcm channel,
waits until it receives the urdf string and then unsubcribes from this
channel.

2) robot_state_listener:
This is a example program that subscribes to tf_t messages published on the 
JOINT_TRANSFORMS channels.
For an example usage, try the following commands in a set of terminals in the specified order:

Term1: ./robot_state_listener
Term2: ./robot_state_publisher
Term3: ./joint_state_publisher (requires the joint_state_publisher pod)
Term4: ./broadcast_robot_model atlas_robot.urdf (requires the robot_model_publisher pod)

3) test_forward_kinematics_solver
This is a example program that subscribes to JOINT_STATES lcm channel to get joint angles
and then shows example usage of the JntToCart routine provided in the forward-kinematics 
SHARED library. At startup, the process creates a subcription to ROBOT_MODEL lcm channel,
waits until it receives the urdf string and then unsubcribes from this
channel.

For an example usage, try the following commands in a set of terminals in the specified order:

Term1: ./test_forward_kinematics_solver
Term2: ./joint_state_publisher (requires the joint_state_publisher pod)
Term3: ./broadcast_robot_model atlas_robot.urdf (requires the robot_model_publisher pod)

4)forward-kinematics library
This library extende the KDL library and it contains a solver class defined in treefksolverposfull_recursive.cpp. 
This class thats provides a JntToCart routine to solve forward kinematics for the whole kinematic structure. 
KDL library functions only provide an interface to query global position between a specified root and a tip segment.
