PracticalSockets is a downloadable file NOT written
by Hunter McClelland, available online (2010/October)
at http://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/practical/CSockets/practical/

I also downloaded UDP examples, and the makefile which can
compile the examples... you probably won't have to do this though.

My code uses PracticalSockets.cpp and PracticalSockets.h as
libraries, and really only utilizes the UDPSocket class and its parents.
