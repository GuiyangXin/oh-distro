To run the UI:

- Install Node.js
- Install socket.io (npm install socket.io)
- Install express (npm install express)
- Run the server:
  - node PidGraph.js
- Navigate to localhost:8080

Right now, this only works if your computer is at 10.2.5X.125.
This can be fixed by a little TLC in the PidTuner class in the robot source.
