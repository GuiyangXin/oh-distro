Making LCM Viewer Movies

==== 1 CAPTURING THE VIEWER SCREEN ====
The record button dumps stills of the viewer screen into an archive of ppm stills (e.g. 2010-05-18-viewer.ppms.gz).

Make sure to create the viewer window with the correct resolution (shown at the bottom-left of the window):
16:9:
   * HD: 1920x1080
   * 3/4 res: 1440x810
   * 1280x720
   * 1/2 res: 960x540
4:3:
   * 1440x1080
   * 1080x810
   * 960x720
   * 720x540
   * 640x480 

Set the Record FPS and resolution to something your system can achieve. More resolution means lower ACHIEVED FPS.

==== 2 CONVERSION OF PPMS.GZ TO AVI/MP4 ====
these scripts used to be part of Agile
they convert the ppms.gz files into avi movies of various formats

Lossless (pretty large file size but no aliasing artifacts): 
lcmviewer-ppms2ffv1avi 6 2010-05-18-viewer.00.ppms.gz 
... this seems to sometimes produce faulty videos - use avidemux  co convert them to properly build videos e.g with xvid

Lossy:
lcmviewer-ppms2mpeg4 4000k 6 2010-05-18-viewer.00.ppms.gz

Windows compatable:
lcmviewer-ppms2msavi 5 25 4000k 25 2012-04-19-viewer.04.ppms.gz 

Corresponding conversions for a series of stills to video:
Lossless
ffmpeg -r 30 -y -vcodec ppm -i %6d.ppm -vcodec ffv1 highquality.avi 

Windows compatiable:
ffmpeg -qscale 5 -r 30 -y -vcodec ppm -i %6d.ppm -vcodec msmpeg4v2 ms_safe.avi
