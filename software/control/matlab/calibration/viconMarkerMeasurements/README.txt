Measurements are recorded in drc/software/control/matlab/calibration/viconMarkerMeasurements/measuredViconMarkerPositions.m, which also computes the marker positions from the measured data and reference points obtained from the meshes.
The images show which marker positions are being measured/computed using red circles.
