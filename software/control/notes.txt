robot_state_t
  angular_position, angular_velocity... not necessarily angular
  there is a *lot* of information passes around in here.  should the state estimate be a different message (which contains this one?)

actuator_cmd_t
  presumes 6 DOF floating base then 1-1 mapping between internal joints and actuators.  not necessarily the case (e.g., pendulum, acrobot, hoveringAtlas, differential drive, ...)
  recommend using the actuator tag


models subdirectory is a (potentially out of sync) duplicate, e.g. of ros_workspace/atlas_description/urdf ?


Some observations (SISIR):

- 'System.nanoTime()' in SendTestStateMessage.java & RobotStatePublisher.java. Our timestamps are in micro secs. (System.nanoTime()/1000) ?
