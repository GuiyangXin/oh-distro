robot coords: +x forward, +y left, +z up
assuming robot origin is:
z=0, z axis given by lower x direction pelvis bar
y=0, symmetry axis of robot
torso rotation cylinder defines x=0,y=0

centroid of vicon plate on robot pelvis wrt approximate robot origin
8 cm forward (+x)
1 cm right (-y)
6.6 cm up (+z)
(accurate to approximately +/- 1mm)
