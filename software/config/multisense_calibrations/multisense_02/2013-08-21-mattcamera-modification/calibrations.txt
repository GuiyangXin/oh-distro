Using table scan from 1 to 3 meters from the head, I get
translation = [0.0336326109089919, -0.0918886920075512, 0.0173175321077842];
quat = [0.711012055836348, 0.0102615250600033, -0.0143234112220476, 0.702959029709255];

Using table objects from 0.5 to 2 meters from the head (probably closer to what we want given the reach of the robot), I get
translation = [-0.00356594047228134, -0.0987599741241146, -0.0132431813457949];
quat = [0.712698928435219, 0.0143598777448354, -0.00577727870739663, 0.701299261634561];
