what if shaper crashes? how do we restart with low bandwidth
remove plan motion affordances as required

goto 2 over reaches
piece 2 - use back for mid-retract

need better plan for reach 3
------------------------------------------


DEBRIS TASK

Operator: Maurice
Wingman: Pat
Monitor: Matt A.
Field team: Steve, Matt D., XXX, XXX, XXX



startup:
run prep and simple grasp scripts
verify robot came up with correct arm config 
   look at arms and legs - are there any joint errors?
did system status messages indicate: irobot left, robotiq right?
calibrate left hand.  watch for visual movement and system status msgs
SKIP create a box and have the planner reach with both hands to it
verify that pat can visualise affordance motion in plans
verify that planner is expecting hand extensions
make sure "plan & control w BDI height" checkbox is turned OFF
  MAURICE -- local change to planner hardcoded parameters

verify that pieces are leaning in the expected way
flat, up right, up left, up right, up left

run calibrate
run prep
run stand
pitch head down
pat, fit affordance to first plank
place a walking goal short of the fitted affordance

CLOCK STARTS

--------------------------------
positioning:

walk close to debris but stop short
raise hands to stow position.  refit affordance.
  VIEWER BUG -- Maurice lost mouse input here
  any reason not to auto-restart from procman?
find best standing point with perception (legs between truss)
walk to standing point
go to manip mode. crouch to 66cm.


--------------------------------
reach 1: reach to side of truss.  IMPORTANT:  Make sure elbow is OUT when lifting
hand fit with 2 fingers facing start line
move pelvis ypr: 0, 0, 0
do 90% reach
refit, touch, grasp
raise height to 90cm.
retract plans


--------------------------------
reach 2: ypr from spreadsheet. careful to reach over piece 3.
  SKIP hand fit with 2 fingers facing start line
  SKIP move pelvis ypr: pitch 5, yaw 5, roll 0
  SKIP do 90% reach
do "go to" posture before sending
refit, touch, grasp
raise pelvis by 5cm and yaw 5degrees to clear wall
raise height to 90cm
make sure to bring arm closer to body to avoid hitting board 3
retract plans


--------------------------------
reach 3:
hand fit with 2 fingers pointing EXACTLY down <<<<<<<<<<
move pelvis ypr: pitch 5, yaw 3, roll 0
do 90% reach. check this is correct - problems with sings XXX
refit, touch, grasp
raise pelvis by 5cm and then yaw 5degrees to clear sidewall
raise height to 90cm.
pelvis pitch to -5, yaw 0
retract plans


--------------------------------
reach 4: => at 12 mins
careful when unpitching the back!
? hand fit with 2 fingers facing toward robot
  ? pelvis yaw 10, roll 0. important to keep good camera seeing
pitch the head up
do 90% reach.
refit, touch, grasp

* after grasp and lift, take pitch out of pelvis

  => at 13 minutes 

MAURICE FIX  raise pelvis 5cm then yaw 5degrees to clear sidewall

raise height to 90cm. slowly xxxxxx get scott to help xxxxxx
pelvis pitch to -5, yaw 0
after small retraction yaw to right with pelvis and back
lift directly up using one of the 3 postures
10. yaw left with back and pelvis


--------------------------------
15 mins
reach 5: make sure to have single finger pointing down to right, makes retract easier
hand fit with XX fingers facing XX
move pelvis ypr: yaw and pitch at max positive
pitch forward 6, be careful unpitching
yaw right
switch to teleop
do 90% reach
refit, touch, grasp

HAD TO RESTART IROBOT HAND DRIVER!  Fixed?

yaw left, raise height a little bit, then to 90 cm.
can i zero back joints with hand stationary - with the new mode? 
retract plans

scored 1 point at 20 mins

reposition to grab truss with right hand at 24 minutes
