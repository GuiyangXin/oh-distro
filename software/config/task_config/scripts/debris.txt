what if shaper crashes? how do we restart with low bandwidth
remove plan motion affordances as required

goto 2 over reaches
piece 2 - use back for mid-retract

need better plan for reach 3

DEBRIS TASK

Operator: Maurice
Wingman: Pat
Monitor: Matt A.
Field team: Steve, Matt D., XXX, XXX, XXX



startup:
run prep and simple grasp scripts
verify robot came up with right arm config. 
   look at arms and legs - are there any joint errors?
did system status messages indicate: irobot left, robotiq right?
calibrate left hand. watch for visual movement and sys status msgs
create a box and have the planner reach with both hands to it
verify that pat can visualise affordance motion in plans
verify that planner is expecting hand extensions
make sure "plan & control w BDI height" is turned OFF


verify that pieces are leaning in the expected way:
flat, up right, up left, up right, up left


--------------------------------
positioning:
walk very close to debris but short. raise hands up to shooter position
stop, find best standing point with perception (legs between truss)
walk to standing point
go to manip mode. crouch to 66cm.


--------------------------------
reach 1: reach to side of truss. IMPORTANT:  Make sure elbow is OUT when lifting
hand fit with 2 fingers facing start line
move pelvis ypr: 0, 0, 0
do 90% reach
refit, touch, grasp
raise height to 90cm.
retract plans


--------------------------------
reach 2: careful to reach over piece 3.
hand fit with 2 fingers facing start line
move pelvis ypr: pitch 5, yaw 5, roll 0
do 90% reach
refit, touch, grasp
raise pelvis by 5cm and yaw 5degrees to clear wall
raise height to 90cm.
make sure to bring arm closer to body to avoid hitting board 3
retract plans


--------------------------------
reach 3: IMPORTANT: Use goto posture to avoid singularity
hand fit with 2 fingers EXACTLY pointing down <<<<<<<<<<
move pelvis ypr: pitch 5, yaw 5, roll 0
do 90% reach. check this is correct - problems with sings XXX
refit, touch, grasp
raise pelvis by 5cm and then yaw 5degrees to clear sidewall
raise height to 90cm.
pelvis pitch to -5, yaw 0
retract plans


--------------------------------
reach 4:
hand fit with 2 fingers facing toward robot
move pelvis ypr: yaw 10, roll 0. important to keep good camera seeing
do 90% reach.
refit, touch, grasp
raise pelvis by 5cm and then yaw 5degrees to clear sidewall
raise height to 90cm. slowly xxxxxx get scott to help xxxxxx
pelvis pitch to -5, yaw 0
after small retraction yaw to right with pelvis and back
lift directly up using one of the 3 postures
10. yaw left with back and pelvis


--------------------------------
reach 5: make sure to have single finger pointing down to right, makes retract easier
hand fit with XX fingers facing XX
move pelvis ypr: y p at max positive
do 90% reach
refit, touch, grasp
raise height to 90cm.
can i zero back joints with hand stationary - with the new mode? 
retract plans
