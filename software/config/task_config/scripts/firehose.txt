redo the experiment with hands rotated
remove cables from smart sensors for april tags
Do the task with the robotiq hand - for backup
Aim for a 15 min time in case we need an intervention

----------
run a series of tests on the iRobot hands to make sure they are behaving in an 
expected way

before clock starts
-------------------
calibrate hands

----------
turn back
go to shooter
fit hand facing into the 
reach
teleop into contact
close hand slowly
Pull the hose down and to the left
