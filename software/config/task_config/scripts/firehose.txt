FIREHOSE TASK

Operator: Maurice
Wingman: Pat
Monitor: Matt A.
Field team: Matt D. wrangling, Steve, Russ field lead, XXX


remaining practices
-------------------
redo experiment with hands rotated
remove cables from smart sensors for april tags
Do the task with the robotiq hand - for backup
Aim for a 15-minute time in case we need an intervention


day before
----------
test iRobot hands to make sure they are behaving as expected

before clock starts
-------------------

run encoder calibration
pat set up data control
*** in KeyframePlanner.m, ensure that "encoders" variable is set to zero
calibrate hands
reset pelvis parameters to defaults - press Send
start the simple grasp script
close robotiq hand for duration

start the robot
calibrating encoders
kill calibration process
run BDI calibration
run prep
drop robot

[AWAIT word from field that slack has been established]

go to stand

go to manip to provoke roll glitch
[ SKIP height to 66cm to spool belay ]

go to stand
set rough walking goal near hose

Get DARPA OK to start clock
start clock

upon task start
---------------

walk to near the hose
head down during approach
on arrival, Pat fit nozzle affordance

set precision walking goal
walk there

go to manip
set pelvis height to 79cm

send back left posture

go to shooter
  [move right hand slightly further away?]

refit affordance
adjust sticky hand to top of nozzle

reach
teleop into contact
try to align top of single finger with top of collar
close hand slowly

EE teleop to down and left (and lower pelvis to XXX cm)

move arm to "walking with hose", execute slowly
zero the back joint
verify that raising pelvis is safe

slowly raise pelvis, then go to stand

set walking goal behind and right; walk
  check for hose unspool

turn to bring wye into view
set walking goal for wye approach; walk
pat update wye fit
lower camera to hand

Send right arm pose "tuckarm"

finish walking to triad

send back left posture

send sucker punch posture [choose which one]

go to manip

reach so that single finger is facing camera
  pat: advise pelvis height needed to match hose and wye height
  pat: advise pelvis yaw
  pat: advise EE teleop needed for contact
  pat: advise pelvis yaw

await confirmation that we've scored point

touch nozzle to wye valve

jam nozzle onto wye valve

do 10% ungrasp

AT END: close robotiq hand at end of experiment

todo

drake designer todos: add wye and hose nozzle frames to drc view, fix frame widget
