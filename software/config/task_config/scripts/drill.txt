mount Robotiq hand to left arm (no extender)
confirm orientation: XXX
mount iRobot hand slightly to right of center


when in place, but before clock starts
--------------------------------------

in KeyframePlanner.m, ensure that "encoders" variable is set to zero
[possible: disable motion safety checks]

run joint calibration
run BDI calibration
[merge start audio server item]
in a.2.P_and_C, kill EncoderCalibration
go to prep
lower the robot

stand
stand for a minute to let IMU converge ?
pat, check IMU yaw rate
pat, enable ground filter

switch to manip to trigger manip glitch
activate hand and hand driver
go to stand
set walking path to auto
set up sensor pull requests
reduce transparency on affordances
pat: set camera views full screen
start ee-driver
uncheck "Plan & Control w/ BDI height" checkbox
  
start maurice's triad thing
set head camera angle
get rough fit of drill on table and wall
place walking goal to table

NOTE to matt d. -- left arm rubs against leg, add velcro

once run starts
---------------

walk to table
wait for stop; refit drill -- VIEWER CRASH
verbal agreement on button orientation
go to manip mode
send pose retract down
send pose retract
send pose pre-grasp high
send reach
send touch
review hand in camera views; tele-op hand
check grasp height on drill (don't block button)
  top of hand should align with top of black plate
close hand

** raise drill with EE-driver before pregrasp-high
** raise drill slightly, press CLOSE again to tighten grasp

send pose: pregrasp-high
send retract
send retract-down
* after grill drasp and hand repositions, zero the back
go to stand

walk to position in front of wall
go to manip
  DISCUSS: LOWER BODY ?
send pose: drill in camera

  IMPORTANT: check that confirmation "will be using manip plan" appears

send pre-drill posture
pat: check drill placement w.r.t. perimeter
drill in
adjust drill depth
...

AFTER triangle, during PUSH phase:
  be aware of left wrist railing against fixed wall
  puncture panel with drill to fixture the panel
  attempt in-plane tearing motions to detach panel

score four points


after run ends
--------------

safely retract hands, keep drill bit away from body

remove hand, stow on head (depends on next task)

 

todo
----

practice drill grasp orientation

add walking goal to drill affordance, determine orientation

need better plans to get the hand up and away from the table

add ee-driver support to robotiq hand

plans not going through

make slightly smaller drill target triangle affordance

TODO
 
Pat, add slider to adjust drill depth in hand
