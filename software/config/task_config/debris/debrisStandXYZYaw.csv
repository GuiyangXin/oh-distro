02_2x6_1,-0.323615,-0.334221,0.66,1.54697,helps to roll/lean into the pile. Get the shoulder over
03_2x6_3,-0.0348461,0.471638,0.7,0.0720657,about half way up the block. Facing in same orientation. Lots of heights work
04_4x4x40_4,-0.65425,-0.527123,0.66,1.60356,same location as block 2

07_4x4x20_4,-0.378337,-0.364018,0.66,1.62164,seems like left arm could reach over and pull this one out on the end with use of pelvis yaw and pitch. No need to foot yaw though

09_2x4_4,-0.353197,-0.450592,0.79,1.54697,could instead grasp from same spot as 10.
10_4x4x40_2,-0.581364,-0.0076541,0.82,1.58029,stand perfectly flat with post and reach blindly onto post with right. Fit perception before you grasp

14_2x4_1,-0.598935,-0.498268,0.66,1.56923,awkward. Depends on lie of pipe. Need to grasp obliquely or with prismatic grasp
