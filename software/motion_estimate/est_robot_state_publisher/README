This is a stub LCM node to publish the estimated robot state. Currently, this is done by echoing the true robot state received from Gazebo.


This software is constructed according to the Pods software policies and
templates.  The policies and templates can be found at:

Name:         est_robot_state_publisher
Maintainers:  rdeits, Sisir

Description: This pod has two executables.

1) est_robot_state_publisher: listens to msgs on TRUE_ROBOT_STATE (will be replaced with MEAS_JOINT_ANGLES for the real platform). Also listens to CAMERA_STATE to get an estimate of the camera's position with respect to the world. Works out forward kinematics and estimates the position of body origin relative to the camera and the world. In this case, the world (0,0,0) is the position camera at time zero.

2) est_robot_state_publisher_no_sensing: Just relays msgs on TRUE_ROBOT_STATE. Use this if you are not publishing perception information. In this case, the world (0,0,0) is the position body origin at time zero.
