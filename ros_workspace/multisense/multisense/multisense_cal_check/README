Running CRL calibration Utility

  The utility utilizes MatLab executables to process
  image and lidar data. You must install the 
  Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) before continuing with the 
  calibration Routine.

  Note: this calibration utility has only been tested on
  Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. It is currently only supported in 
  this configuration.

  (1) Install MCR

   Navigate to the following link and install MCR 2013a for 
   Linux

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html

   Note: After unpacking the .zip file run sudo ./install in
   the extracted directory. This will allow you to place MCR
   in the default /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime location.
   This utilty, by default, assumes you have installed MCR in the default location.
   It is possible to specify a different path through command line
   arguments.

  (2) Run Camera Calibration

   The Multisense v2.0 driver must be running for this to work.

   In addition in the termial where the cal_checker will run the ROS
   environmental variables must be sourced which contain the path to the 
   multisense v2.0 ros driver (most likely a setup.bash file)

   Navigate to the directory where the cal_check executable is located.
   
   Note: a process_bags.py file and a distrib directory should also be located
   in the cal_check directory.
   
   Run the following command to check the multisense-sl calibration
   
   ./cal_check <options>
   usage: ./cal_check <options>
   Where <options> are
       -n <exe_name>        specifies the name of the CRL cal checker executable (default= run_MULTISENSE_SL_CHECK_CAL.sh)
       -d <exe_dir>         specifies the directory the CRL cal checker executable (default './distrib')
       -t <tmp_dir>         specifies the temp directory to save files.(default= automatically generated directory in /tmp)
       -m <MCR_dir>         directory Matlab MCR  is installed (default=/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81)
       -b <bag_dir>         specifies the directory to save bag files. (default='.')
       -o <out_dr>          specifies the directory to save the calibration results
       -c                   do not remove temporary directory
       -h                   get help
