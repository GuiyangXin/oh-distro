Basic info to get set up:
* the hands are not backdrivable
* IPs: 192.168.40.47 / 192.168.40.49. Each hand has an identifying sticker on it (47 or 49).
* download software and documentation from irobot.leapfile.com, (mit:DRCiRobotHand)
* follow quick start guide in OwnersManual pdf from leapfile tarball. Don't worry about 'ERROR: cannot open annan device'; this is just a midi slider board that can be used to send commands to the hand.
* Naming conventions can be found in the OwnersManual pdf as well
* I changed /etc/network/interfaces according to the manual. Maybe I didn't set things up right, but I have to run 'sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart' every time I hook up the robot to the PC
* I added the hands' IP addresses to /etc/hosts so that you can use irobot47 or irobot49 instead of the IP addresses
* logging into the hand: ssh root@irobot47. Password awareroot.
* updating hand firmware: I followed instructions in email with subject "iRobot DRC hand urgent update" to the letter. It took 3 times to flash everything without errors (using ./iflash $MICRO_CONTROLLER_NUMBER)
* HandleSensors.msg and HandleControl.msg in handle/handle_msgs/msg show the different types of sensor information, including units, as well as control commands.
* when logged into the hand (note that handle_controller is hidden): ./handle_controller --help
* on own computer, can use to move fingers using short velocity control commands, allowing you to manually calibrate: 'rosrun handle_launch key_control.sh 47' to control hand 47
* on hand: ./testscript.sh
* this exists, but it's for the ARM-H model: https://github.com/robotics/handle_wrapper
* the automatic calibration routine has never worked for us up to this point.
* The zero configuration of the hand has all of the fingers opened as far as possible and finger spread such that F1 and F2 are parallel

Manual calibration
The goal is to calibrate the incremental encoders measuring the excursion of the tendons. These are zeroed at hand startup.
* run key_control script as described above
* close finger 3 all the way with motor 3, then reel in motor 4 until the finger just starts to move back
* open up all three fingers completely, but keep tension in the tendons
* restart the hand.

Running Sisir's power grasp python script:
* roscore
* rosrun mit_helios_scripts launch_hand_driver.sh IROBOT R 49
* rosrun handle_launch power_grasp_keyboard_teleop.py 49
