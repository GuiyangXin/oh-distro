Basic info to get set up:
* IP: 192.168.40.47
* download stuff from irobot.leapfile.com, (mit:DRCiRobotHand)
* follow quick start guide in OwnersManual pdf from leapfile tarball. Don't worry about 'ERROR: cannot open annan device'; this is just a midi slider board that can be used to send commands to the hand
* I changed /etc/network/interfaces according to the manual
* I added the robot's IP to /etc/hosts so that you can use irobot47 instead of the IP address
* logging into the hand: ssh root@irobot47. Password awareroot.
* updating hand: I followed instructions in email with subject "iRobot DRC hand urgent update" to the letter. It took 3 times to flash everything without errors (using ./iflash $MICRO_CONTROLLER_NUMBER)
* looked at HandleSensors.msg and HandleControl.msg in handle/handle_msgs/msg
* logged into the hand (note that handle_controller is hidden): ./handle_controller --help
* on own computer, can use to move fingers: rosrun handle_launch key_control.sh 
* on hand: ./testscript.sh

To run python script:
roscore
rosrun mit_helios_scripts launch_hand_driver.sh IROBOT R 49
rosrun handle_launch power_grasp_keyboard_teleop.py 49

Random:
* this exists, but it's for the ARM-H model: https://github.com/robotics/handle_wrapper
* visualize_simplified.launch
