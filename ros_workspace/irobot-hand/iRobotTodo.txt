ON HOLD:
* visualize hand configuration using proximal joint angle encoders See line 597 ofdrc/ros_workspace/translators/src/ros2lcm_hands.cpp
* explore contact sensing

TODO:
* check that everything works with 2 hands connected
* closing safety (wear prevention)
* investigate 'getting stuck' in position control mode

FOCUS FOR TODAY:
* get rid of unused methods in IRobotHandController, add optional arguments

BUSY:
* improve visualization

DONE:
* ping hand
* update 47 firmware to latest
* open hand
* do sensor_poll test
* update 49 firmware to latest
* send poll to Maurice
* try to fix 47
* send iRobot motor coil resistances
* change ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
* clean install of drc software
* get python script to run
* calibrate absolute encoders
* change python script to use radians instead of encoder ticks
* improve documentation
* email: angle control
* write makefile
* measure motor coil resistances for 49
* update firmware
* get angle control to work
* send email to iRobot: angle control, motor coil resistances
* update 49 firmware to latest
* send smart fingers to iRobot
* try visualize_simplified.launch
* get set up with PyDev
* improve helios_scripts/launch_hand_driver.sh 
* experiment with current control
* email: current control binary?
* get calibration jig
* do current control test from command line, send email
* email iRobot about current control
* figure out what's wrong with #44
* update firmware on 44
* figure out what's broken on 45
* put dumb fingers on 44
* iRobot weekly report
* contact iRobot: spectra gauge, other options for tendons, tendon abrasion on smart fingers
* add date to config file
* online calibration routine for dumb fingers
* record configuration when in calibration jig
* test repeatability of calibration routine
* update usage
* send 45 back
* find good iRobot hand travel bag
* update drc software, package manager
* make stuff work from bot-procman-sheriff
* python script r/l case insensitive
* svn:ignore
* fix network setup
* move mit_irobot_hand_control.py and mit_keyboard_control out of handle and into mit_helios_scripts
* put mit_irobot_hand_control.py into a script file or into the PMD
* make it run for both left and right if necessary
* write a ros script that launches everything properly
* order of launching translator and iRobot driver
* drc-viewer interface for opening and closing hands
* check if translator needs to be updated
* weekly status update
* do a better job of visualizing joint angles in the viewer
* add option for positon control close using a percentage
* add options for different grasps (i.e. different spread values)
* command line tool to send high level ros commands for hand
* add option to close a single finger
* improve command line tool help
* update wiki page
* skip translation from LCM to ROS
* weekly status update
* make 10 spare tendons
* fix find_calibration_pose script
* better calibration pose
* calibrate distal joint angles using smart fingers, use to estimate them based on motor tendon excursion
