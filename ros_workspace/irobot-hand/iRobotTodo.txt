ON HOLD:
* check if translator needs to be updated
* visualize hand configuration using proximal joint angle encoders See line 597 ofdrc/ros_workspace/translators/src/ros2lcm_hands.cpp
* explore contact sensing
* drc-viewer interface for opening and closing hands

TODO:
* move mit_irobot_hand_control.py and mit_keyboard_control out of handle and into mit_helio_scripts
* put mit_irobot_hand_control.py into a script file or into the PMD
* make it run for both left and right if necessary
* write a ros script that launches everything properly
* correctly visualise the joint angles in the viewer
* make it possible to calibrate spread, thumb antagonistic
* closing safety (wear prevention)
