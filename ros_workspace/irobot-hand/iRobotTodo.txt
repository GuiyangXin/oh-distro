ON HOLD:
* check if translator needs to be updated
* visualize hand configuration using proximal joint angle encoders See line 597 ofdrc/ros_workspace/translators/src/ros2lcm_hands.cpp
* explore contact sensing
* drc-viewer interface for opening and closing hands

TODO:

FOCUS FOR TODAY:
* test repeatability of calibration routine
* send 45 back
* good iRobot hand travel bag
* online calibration routine for dumb fingers

BUSY:

DONE:
